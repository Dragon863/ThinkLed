# ThinkLED

![Demo image](https://github.com/Dragon863/ThinkLED/blob/main/img/demo.png?raw=true)

ThinkLED is a simple flutter app for thinkpads using `tpacpi` on linux. It can be used to toggle the power and lid LEDs, or transmit a message in morse code using the lid LED.
- To run, simply download the latest release or if you want to build it from source, install flutter and run `flutter run`.
- This is a fairly simple application, as I am new to flutter
- This is inspired by the rust script `thinkmorse`, found [here](https://github.com/theritvars/thinkmorse-rust)
